### Hello there, I'm Jimmy! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Fullstack Developer who's passionate about React, Redux, Javascript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.

Take a look at some of the projects I've done: 

+ [Recipistic](https://github.com/JimmyKuangg/Recipistic) - A full stack clone of the food blogging website, Epicurious.

+ [Build-A-Burger](https://github.com/JimmyKuangg/build-a-burger) - A small game built on Javascript that requires you to be fast and send out as many burgers as you can within the time limit.

+ [Pantry Chef](https://github.com/JimmyKuangg/Pantry_Chef) - A MERN stack application that gives users recipe suggestions based on what they have available.

If my projects didn't already give it away, I'm also very passionate about food and cooking! Food is always a great way to connect with people as well.
